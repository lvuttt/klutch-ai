Klutch AI Take-home Assignment: ChatGPT for 
Construction Docs 
1. Goal 
Design and prototype a ChatGPT-like assistant for the construction world, capable of answering 
factual, grounded questions based on a document provided by the user. 
This AI should behave like a helpful site assistant - it doesn’t hallucinate, and all its answers 
must come from real information in the documents it’s given. 
 
2. What We’re Looking For
 
● Clear thinking: How you frame the problem and make decisions 
● Creativity in modeling or tool usage 
● A proof-of-concept or partial demo (code snippets, notebooks, or mini app) 
● Light code is OK - we care more about what you choose to build and why. 
● You don’t have to build every feature, but we would love to see a functional demo for the 
key features 
● Feel free to use AI to assist your development 
 
3. The Assignment
 
a. Inputs 
You’ll work with a real construction document. The example is attached in the email. 
Assume this is one of many documents a user might upload. 
b. Task 
Build a mini system that allows: 
1. The user to upload a PDF construction document 
2. The assistant to answer factual questions grounded in that document 
Example user questions: 

● What’s the size of the bathtub on the second floor? 
● What type of cooktop is used for the kitchen? 
● Is weather stripping required for the doors? 
● What’s the size of the house number? 
 
4. What You Should Submit 
Please include the following in a single GitHub repo or ZIP: 
1. README: Describe: 
○ Your system architecture and reasoning 
○ How your approach ensures factual grounding 
○ What tradeoffs you made 
○ How you would scale this 
2. Prototype or sample code (language of your choice): 
○ This can be a small web app, a Jupyter notebook, or a script that shows the core 
idea working 
3. Sample Q&A results - Include at least 2-3 sample questions and the assistant’s 
response 
 
5. Time Limit 
We expect this to take ~3 hours. You don’t need to make it perfect — we just want to see how 
you think and build. 
 
6. Submission 
Please send your repo link or ZIP back to us within 48-72 hours (or suggest a timeline that 
works for you).
